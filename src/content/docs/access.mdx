# Access & Getting Started

GP‑STOR is designed to be easy to access from campus and national CI ecosystems.

## Who can use GP‑STOR?

Researchers and educators associated with institutions in the Great Plains region, as well as projects within NRP, OSG, and ACCESS programs (additional communities may be supported as policies evolve).

## Access methods

- OSG/NRP Mounts: For high‑throughput computing (HTC) jobs
- OSDF Origin Nodes: For publishing and serving datasets
- Globus: For managed, high‑performance file transfers
- Nextcloud: For web‑based access, collaboration, and sharing

## Requesting access

Access policies, allocation processes, and request forms will be published with the production service launch. In the interim:

- Talk to your campus CI lead or research computing support
- Identify your project, anticipated storage needs, and collaborators
- Note any integration requirements (OSG/NRP, Globus, ACCESS)

> Allocation models and AUPs (Acceptable Use Policies) will be posted here as soon as they are finalized.

## Example workflows

- Stream instrument data to the high‑speed tier for AI/ML preprocessing and analysis
- Land simulation outputs into the object tier; distribute curated results with Globus
- Mount GP‑STOR in OSG/NRP HTC jobs for distributed data processing
