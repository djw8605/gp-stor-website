We're excited to announce the GP-STOR project - a collaborative effort to provide distributed, resilient storage infrastructure across the Great Plains region.

## What is GP-STOR?

GP-STOR is designed to accelerate research by providing:

- **14 PB of redundant Ceph object storage** plus 384 TB of high-speed solid-state storage
- **Three-site resilience** across University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, and University of South Dakota
- **Multiple access methods** including mounts for OSG and NRP, OSDF Origin nodes, Globus endpoints, and Nextcloud

## Getting Involved

We're currently in the infrastructure acquisition phase, with beta user access planned for Q3 2026. Stay tuned for updates!
