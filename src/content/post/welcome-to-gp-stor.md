We're excited to announce GP-STOR, the Great Plains Scalable Tiered Object Repository!

## What is GP-STOR?

GP-STOR provides distributed, resilient storage infrastructure designed to accelerate research across the Great Plains region. Our platform offers:

- **14 PB** of redundant Ceph object storage
- **384 TB** of high-speed solid-state storage
- Three-site resilience across Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota
- Multiple access methods including OSG, NRP, Globus, and Nextcloud

## Getting Started

We're currently in our beta phase and actively seeking early adopters to help us test and refine the platform. 

Interested in becoming a beta user? Check out our [access page](/documentation/access/) to learn more about how to get started.

## Roadmap

We're working toward full public access in Q4 2026. In the meantime, we're:

1. Finalizing infrastructure acquisition (Q4 2025)
2. Receiving and installing hardware (Q1 2026)
3. Deploying and configuring the CEPH clusters (Q1-Q2 2026)
4. Onboarding beta users (Q3 2026)

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through our deployment schedule!
